# N-Body Problem Simulation

This project simulates the gravitational interactions between multiple celestial bodies using the n-body problem framework. It provides an API for users to input initial conditions and retrieve simulation results, along with visualization tools to display these results.

## Features

- **API Interface**: Built with FastAPI, allowing users to interact with the simulation engine.
- **Simulation Engine**: Models gravitational interactions using classical physics principles.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to animate and visualize the simulation results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nbodyproblem
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the API

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api:app --reload
   ```
2. Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /**: Returns a welcome message.
- **POST /simulate**: Accepts a list of celestial bodies, an end time, and a time step to perform the simulation. Returns the simulation results as a JSON object.

### Example Request

```json
POST /simulate
{
  "bodies": [
    {
      "name": "Earth",
      "mass": 5.972e24,
      "position": [1.496e11, 0],
      "velocity": [0, 29780]
    },
    {
      "name": "Sun",
      "mass": 1.989e30,
      "position": [0, 0],
      "velocity": [0, 0]
    }
  ],
  "endtime": 31536000,
  "timestep": 604800
}
```

### Running the Simulation Script

1. Execute the simulation script directly to visualize the results:
   ```bash
   python nbodyproblem/solver.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- **api.py**: Contains the FastAPI application and endpoint definitions.
- **nbodyproblem/solver.py**: Implements the core simulation logic and visualization.
- **nbodyproblem/models**: Contains data models for celestial bodies and time series.

## Dependencies

- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
